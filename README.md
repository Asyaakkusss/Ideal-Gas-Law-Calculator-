# Project Objective 
The objective of this project is to use machine learning to determine whether or not a substance is under safe conditions given certain information about its flammability. The goal is to qualitatively and quantitatively ascertain how likely a substance is to burst into flames given the conditions it is under (such as temperature, pressure, oxygen concentration, and molar mass). 

The flammability of a substance can be defined through ascertaining its flammability characteristics. These are: 

1. Flash point - minimum temperature at which 
2. Auto ignition temperature
3. Upper flammability limits
4. Lower flammability limits
